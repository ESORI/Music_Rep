# TODOs
### TODO1
Remove all non aggregate repositories (e.g. ArtistData).

DONE->Artist should have a property called data of type ArtistData

### TODO2

Avoid name shortcuts like nSongs, don't let others guess the meaning


EXTRA NOTES
--
REDO ARTIST JDBC
ARTIST JDBC WILL HANDLE ARTISTDATA AND ALBUMS
USER WILL HANDLE USERDATA AND PLAYLIST_USER
SONG WILL HANDLE WELL PLAYLIST_SONG
WHEN UPDATING, IF DEPENDENT TABLE HAS ALREADY EXISTING VALUE WE UPDATE (PRIVATE EXTRA METHOD) AND IF IT DOESN'T WE INSERT IT
COPY MUSIC_REP TO MUSIC_REP_JPA
